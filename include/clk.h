/**
 * A clock is a hardware signal that oscillates autonomously at a specific
 * frequency and duty cycle. Most hardware modules require one or more clock
 * signal to drive their operation. Clock signals are typically generated
 * externally to the HW module consuming them, by an entity this API calls a
 * clock provider. This API provides a standard means for drivers to enable and
 * disable clocks, and to set the rate at which they oscillate.
 *
 * A driver that implements UCLASS_CLOCK is a clock provider. A provider will
 * often implement multiple separate clocks, since the hardware it manages
 * often has this capability. clk-uclass.h describes the interface which
 * clock providers must implement.
 *
 * Clock consumers/clients are the HW modules driven by the clock signals. This
 * header file describes the API used by drivers for those HW modules.

 * either (a) add more fields to allow clock providers to store additional
 * information, or (b) replace the id field with an opaque pointer, which the
